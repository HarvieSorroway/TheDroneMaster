A little animal, on the floor of my chamber, is this reaching you?
It is obvious that you are not a product of natural evolution. I'm wondering who your creator are.
Sorry, I don't have any idea of the blueprints of your body,<LINE>and my communication array is already offline so I can't announce your existence to anyone else.
Due to the scan of parts of your structure, you have the ability to read and store information.<LINE>Your creator seems to want you to be able to gather all kinds of information across as far as possible.
From the video sent back by my overseers, it seems that you will inflict violence on the scavengers.
Well, I would recommend you to go to my top city and say hello to the neighbors there.
Although a purposed organism similar to yours managed to kill their chief not long ago,<LINE>it looks like they continue to destroy my top structure.
Given that the purpose of your journey is to gather information, maybe then we can all get what we want.
I have to get back to work, and I hope you gather the ideal information.
Oh, you're back, little creature.
How was your journey?
Apparently I can't get any useful information from your hollow eyes.
If you can keep quiet, I may allow you to stop for a little longer.
But now I have to keep working.
Great success!
The way they say it works really works!
Oh little one you are awake, how does it feel to be in this world?
